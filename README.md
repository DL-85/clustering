# Sequence clustering

This repository contains the sequence clustering algorithm employed by the VOT committee to generate balanced sequence datasets for the VOT challenges. Since this functionality is not used by most users we have separated it from the VOT toolkit to make it less complex. Note that you will still need the toolkit installed before you can use the clustering algorithm.
